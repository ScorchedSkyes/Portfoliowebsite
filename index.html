     <h3>About Kris Harder</h3>
     <div>
       <p>After graduating highschool and trying my hand at a variety of jobs, I was left unfulfilled<br> but kept trying to find my place.<br> Soon after meeting my spouse, I followed her to another state where I lived with her while she went to school.<br> During this time I dabbled in IT and hardware repair.</p>
       <p>That's when I first found my love for technology.<br> I have built computers and played games in the past.<br> That was nothing compaired to creating my own webpages and little games.<br>It was a lot of fun, but I never imagined I could do it full time and support my growing family.</p>
       <p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/"><b>Thinkful</b></a>, that has changed.<br> I am able to create works of art that can inspire and influence the world.<br> I love what I do and am excited to find a team that I can help support so that we can explore this galaxy together.<br> Can't wait to hear from you!</p>
